# Changelog

Append-only log of work completed during autonomous overnight sessions and
notable manual changes. Newest entries on top.

Format per entry:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — task #N: short title
- What changed (file paths, behavior)
- What was tested (build pass, manual click-through, smoke test)
- Any cost incurred (Apify credits, Resend emails sent)
- Blockers surfaced (link to "Blocked — needs Cami" section if any)
```

If a task ends up blocked, also add a section at the bottom:

```
## Blocked — needs Cami
- **Task #N:** specific question / decision needed, with enough context that
  she can answer in <30 seconds when she wakes up
```

If you spot orphaned UI elements, broken bits, or weird state during another
task, log them at the bottom under "Drive-by observations" — don't go on a
tangent.

## 2026-04-16 22:05 — task #1: verify Apify integration end-to-end
- Added `scripts/test-apify.ts` — quick smoke test harness for both actors.
- Ran against `@nike` (public) with limit=3 per actor.
- **TikTok (clockworks/tiktok-scraper)**: all fields populated — views, likes,
  comments, shares/saves (implicitly via `diggCount`/`shareCount`), postedAt
  (UNIX seconds → Date), link, thumbnailUrl (`videoMeta.coverUrl`), title
  (`text`). No remapping needed.
- **Instagram (apify/instagram-scraper)**: likes, comments, title (caption),
  postedAt (ISO), link, thumbnailUrl all populated. Views only populate on
  reels (`videoViewCount`/`videoPlayCount`) — feed photos/carousels return 0,
  which matches IG's actual API behavior (no view count exposed there). Saves
  and shares are 0 across the board — IG scraper doesn't expose them.
- Cost: ≈6 results × $0.001/result ≈ **$0.006 burned** (negligible).
- No code fixes needed in `src/lib/social/apify.ts`.

## 2026-04-16 22:30 — tasks #2 + #3: auto-onboarding tasks
- **Schema:** added `ONBOARDING` to `TaskType`, made `Task.campaignId`
  nullable, added `UploadCategory` enum (`CONTENT` / `ONBOARDING_DOCS`),
  made `Upload.campaignId` nullable, added `Upload.category` column
  default `CONTENT`. Migration
  `20260416000000_onboarding_tasks_uploads/migration.sql`.
- **Tenant filter change:** tasks + uploads APIs now tenant-check via
  `creator.teamId` instead of `campaign.teamId`, so orphan onboarding rows
  (campaignId = null) remain visible.
- New helper `src/lib/tasks/onboarding.ts` creates two tasks (tax form,
  FTC + account warming) due 7 days out, idempotent by (creatorId, title).
- Hooked into application-approve flow right after pinned welcome message
  creation in `src/app/api/applications/[applicationId]/route.ts`.
- Tax form task body references "Onboarding documents" destination in the
  Uploads tab. `creator-upload-form.tsx` now shows that option in the
  dropdown; selecting it sets `category=ONBOARDING_DOCS` + `campaignId=null`.
- **TaskItem** now renders expandable `description` body (chevron toggle,
  preserves whitespace) so creators can read the FTC warming instructions.
- `// TODO: templatize brand name` placed next to the Chipped-specific copy.
